    <h1>Place to visit in Banteay Meanchey</h1>
    <h2>1.Phnom Bak and Phnom Chenh Chiang</h2>
    <p>Phnom Bak and Phnom Chenh Chiang are the natural and cultural resort locating at Se Rey Sa Phoan District, along
        the National Road No 5, about 5kilometers west of Banteay Meanchey provincial town. The two mountains are near
        one another. The vertical faces of the mountains a like a wall. At the flank, there is a place for visitors to
        relax. At the foot of the mountain is a large well, 10 squar meters and 12 meters deep. Some stone statues are
        sculptured there. There are also a number of vendors selling stone sculptures.</p>
    <h2>2.Weaving Handicraft</h2>
    <p>51 km (1h:42mn) From Provincial Town. Location: Road No. 6, Srah Chik Village, Poy Char Commune, Phnom Srok
        District.</p>
    <h2>3.Banteay Chhmar Temple</h2>
    <p>Is the historical site which was built between 12th and 13th centuries during the reign of King, Jar Varman VII.
        The temple is located at Thmar Puok District, along the National Road No 69A, about 59 kilimeters north of the
        province town. Nowadays, the temple is damaged because of war and gangs of offendees who have stolen statues and
        the temple stone for selling them to Thailand. In addition, there are some other temples in Ban Teay Mean Chey
        province such as Pra Sat Preah Chhor and Pra Sat Pram as well that have mostly been abandoned and not arranged.

        At Present, Ban Teay Chhmar temple is the main tourist attractive site of the province in luring foreign
        tourists to visit. In the far northwestern corner of Cambodia the looted Angkorian temple of Banteay Chhmar sits
        teetering on the brink of a revival. A paved road scheduled to start construction this year is bound to increase
        visitors. Craig Gerard braves the bumpy journey to find a slice of Cambodian tranquillity. Commissioned by King
        Jayavarman VII and situated some 15km from the Thai border, Banteay Chhmar is often compared to Angkor Thom in
        size and structure. The complex is full of sandstone bas-reliefs that tell stories of ancient Cambodian battles.
        Witnessing the preservation of the temple and experiencing the beauty of the local community will reward the
        adventurous traveller.

        The bas-reliefs along the surrounding wall of the temple are some of the finest in Cambodia. Yet the stories are
        incomplete due to sustained looting, which continued as late as 2002. Huge sections of the outer wall have been
        chiselled away, and are now scattered to the four winds. While the loss is felt as you wander around the massive
        complex, it also drives home the importance of visitors to this remote site. These tourist dollars lead to the
        long-run stability of the temple and the surrounding villages.Such is the hope of Global Heritage Fund (GHF), a
        non-profit organisation based in California.

        It specialises in tying conservation of historical sites to the needs of the local community to make tourism
        relevant and profitable, while ensuring local inhabitants are stewards of their own heritage. James Hooper, the
        manager of Global Heritage Fund UK and International Project Development specialist, sees great potential in
        Banteay Chhmar.Banteay Chhmar is a perfect example of how Global Heritage Fund works with local groups to build
        sustainable tourist infrastructure,? says Hooper. Through their partnership with the Community Based Tourism
        (CBT) office, Global Heritage Fund has been able to speed along the conservation work by providing the technical
        know-how and needed funding. Additionally,it assists with emergency structural issues within the complex. Years
        of shifting earth, some looting and the advancing trees have taken their toll on Banteay Chhmar. I get the sense
        that the forest is reclaiming the temple for itself.

        Hooper wants to create temporary, low-impact viewing platforms, so guests can see the complex from a bird?s eye
        view. The platforms would allow visitors a safe way to experience the heart of the temple, which currently is
        inaccessible because of unstable stone structures. Hooper explains that these temporary structures work well
        because they avoid heavy construction which could do long term damage to the site. For now, visitors walk on the
        ground amongst the ruins, witnessing the temple as westerners first discovered it. The CBT has a clear list of
        plans needed to improve services to tourists. According to Sophal That of the CBT, about 40 percent of visitors
        spend a night in one of the villages? six homestay locations, the only overnight option.

        The homestays make up just a part of the CBT?s infrastructure around the Banteay Chhmar complex. The rest of the
        74 council members are part of the hospitality network for visitors, which includes ox cart rides, silk weaving,
        woodcarving, traditional music concerts, rice wine distillation, beekeeping, bike tours and the women?s cooking
        group. While more tourists are exactly what the community needs, busloads may be unfortunate. The isolation is
        what gives Banteay Chhmar its charm no matter what time of day you visit, you are likely to be the only
        visitors. For the time being, there is no waiting for the hordes to move so you can snap a photo without people.
        There are no tuk tuks, no elephants, no mega-buses.

        There is just the temple, nature and friendly people there to help.All this makes now the right time for a
        visit.Banteay Meanchey is a Cambodian province in the northwest of the country, and its national reconciliation
        only the Khmer Rouge trick), the province and towns are striving to rebuild their culture and economy. area was
        part of the extensive Khmer empire, with its most notable remains the Banteay Chhmar temple (built in 12th and
        13th century) in the north of the province.In the 17th century the Siam took control over Cambodia, and made the
        area of the modern province part of Sisophon Province. In the year 1907 the Siam had to cede control to the
        French, and the area was then included into Battambang Province.

        In 1988 the province Banteay Meanchey was split off from Battambang.Banteay Meanchey is located in the Northwest
        of Cambodia. It borders with Thailand to the west and North, with Oddar Meancheay to the North, with Siem Reap
        to the East and with Battambang to the South. The town of Sisophorn is about 359km from Phnom Penh via national
        road number 5. One of the most known places in that province is Poipet, a town ontheThailand/Cambodia border.
        It?s the key crossing point between the two countries, and also extremely popular as a gambling destination with
        lot' s of casinos (gambling is popular, but illegal in Thailand). There is a strip of casinos, guesthouses and
        hotels between the Thai and Cambodian passport control counters, enabling Thais to gamble in Cambodia without
        needing to go through Cambodian mmigration. Poipet is adjacent to the city of Aranya Pratet on the Thai side of
        the border.
