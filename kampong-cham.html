    <h1>Place to visit in Kampong Cham</h1>
    <h2>1.Preah Theat Teuk Chhar</h2>
    <p>Preah Theat Teuk Chhar is a group of temples in Thmo Da village, Beung Nay commune and Thmei village, Krouch
        commune in Prey Chhar district, about 39 kilometers from Kampong Cham provincial town. Visitors can reach Preah
        Theat Teuk Chhar by taking National Road 7 from Kampong Cham, turn right at the provincial road and drive 13
        kilometers before turning right again and driving another 5 kilometers along a canal trail, to the temple site.
        The temples were constructed in AD 1005, during the reign of King Suryavarman I. As proposed by King's adviser
        Chung Chheal (also named Chekngak Khealleah or Leaksintra), the King agreed to build these temples, and
        Leaksintra started construction on the site called Sithiborya that which owned by the King, who also contributed
        money. Leaksintra, however, used his salesmanship to encourage the local people to contribute money as well,
        until the project was finished.

        One of the temples houses a Shiva lingam named Sreipatresvara, and two divinity statues called Paramesvara and
        Sarasvata at both sides. Another cavelike temple believed to house a god is located along a canal, near a
        waterfall. Badly damaged over the years, only one door frame remains today, and it is overgrown with vegetation.
        The architect excavated a large pond on the right side of the temple called Leaksintrada. A golden Silva lingam
        was kept in the middle of the pond. Nearby, a village of wealthy people was formed. In addition, people from
        nearby villages were invited to live there, too, and the village soon became a crowded but cheerful town.
        Leaksintra told the king of the new town, and the king went there to celebrate the town's inauguration in AD
        1025. He gave the city numerous gifts, including 29 soldiers and a rice field that surrounded the temple.

        He had ponds dug and a huge court built for festival celebrations, and he gave decorations for the temple. He
        named the site Leaksintrabot in honor of its architect, Leaksintra. Later, the site became a place for religious
        worship. The religions practiced changed from king to king. Some kings practiced Brahmanism, while some
        practiced Mahayana Buddhism. Others were Theravada Buddhists, which explains why there are so many small temples
        at Preah Theat Teuk Chhar. All told, there are 551 small temples which are influenced by Brahmanism and
        Buddhism.Some of the temples contain statues of heroes who gave their lives for the nation. Many of the temples
        were destroyed by years of war. Others were heavily damaged. Today, monks and visitors to the site search in
        hopes of finding the name and foundations of these temples so they might be rebuilt. Some temples have been
        rebuilt already, their wood and tile roofing replaced with concrete.</p>
    <h2>2.Man-Made Resort Of Teuk Chha - Kampong Cham</h2>
    <p>Next to the temple, there is a canal existing since the ancient time. The canal has water all year round, either
        dry or raing seasons; water which is clear and non-stopped flowing which leads to attracting tourists to enjoy
        it happily. On either side of the clear-water canal, there are plants and trees growing; but now these plants
        and trees have been cut off to make a big plain where the wast water spreads out at the rock temple.

        In order to take advantage from the canal, a dam has been constructed to provide water to big rice fields in
        Prey Chhor District, Kampong Cham Pronvice and in Ba Ray District, Kampon Thom province. Because the area is the
        cool place with great quantity of water and cool shadow from the trees that are growing around the ancient
        temple, these can sometime attract tourists to visit and enjoy during their holiday leading to be well known.
        Nowadays, the ancient pond, which we described as the achievement of Dr. Chung Kheal is the wast-water pond
        located in front of the dam that has been just constructed recently.

        The canal has water flowing from above and has source at the North in Kampong Cham province; the water flows
        from the North to the East, when touching a side of the temple, it flows down into a big slit. From the ancient
        time, the slit has been full of water; but there are small currents of water shared from the slit, then flow
        into rice fields of the surrounding villages such as Kroch village in Sre Chhor District as well. Because the
        canal is old, the Ministry of Agriculture has organized a dam for stocking water in order to accelerate the
        water flow of the canal to thousand Hectars of rice fields in districts of Prey Chhor and Ba Ray.

        The canal of Teuk Chha has corner where they can enjoy swimming; if someone like swimming in the shallow water,
        he/she can swim in the old canal, North of the dam because the bottom of the old canal has four-meter or
        five-meter width. The clear water, we can see its bottom with flock of small fish swimming in reverse direction
        to the water flow. If some one like swimming in deep water, he can swim in a wast water, South of the dam.
        Around the Slit of the canal bank, there is a high tree which provide shelter to tourists and birds.

        The water surface of Teuk Chha has appoximate 3-square kilometre size filled by nearly 10 sources at the
        Northeast Mountain and plateau called Kbal Teuk. The tank of stocked water has appoximately more than two-metre
        depth and pours to three accesses: two accesses via the dam can be closed and opened, and another one is the
        10-meter Slit, North of the dam. The first dam is opened every day; the water flows down sounding as water fall;
        this can attract tourists to enjoy swimming. The second dam is opened during the festival days sometime; the
        water flow is not strong.</p>
