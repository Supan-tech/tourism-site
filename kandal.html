    <h1>Place to visit in Kandal</h1>
    <h2>1. Saang Phnom</h2>
    <p>Saang Phnom is located in Saang Phnom commune, 23 kilometers from Takmao, or 34 kilometers from Phnom Penh. To
        reach the site, travel along new National Road 21, which was constructed during the Khmer Rouge regime, via Tuol
        Krosang plain. From Takmao, new National Road 21 meets old National Road 21 at Wat Chhoung Leap, Rokar Kpus
        commune. The distance is about 12 kilometers. From Wat Chhoung Leap drive 5 kilometers to Saang district market
        and look for a trail on the right. Go another 2.5 kilometers until you see the pagoda gate. Turn right and go
        another 2.5 kilometers to reach the hill.

        There is a pagoda at the top of the hill. Saang Phnom has fewer trees than Phnom Thon Mond, but a big lake
        surrounds the hill, and there are many Rumchong and Prolit flowers (a kind of white or yellow water lily with a
        long edible stalk). The lake is full of fish, and many visitors enjoy taking boat rides and fishing. During the
        rainy season, Saang Phnom looks like a small forest island. The air is cool and fresh there. Recently, the
        provincial tourism services, working with local authorities, planted more trees and improved security and
        sanitary conditions for tourists. The site is especially popular during traditional festivals and public
        holidays.</p>
    <h2>2. Phnom Udong</h2>
    <p>Phnom Udong is located in Psar Dek and Phnom Bat communes, Ponhea Leu district, about 41 kilometers north of
        Phnom Penh. The city drops behind while fishing villages and rice paddies surround either side of the sweeping
        plains of Kandal province. Then without warning, a mountain rises above it all, topped by the spire of stupas
        like some fairy castle. The road to Udong is clearly marked, and the distance along this road to the former city
        is less than 4 kilometers. Picnic huts selling everything from sweet palm fruit to roasted chicken cluster
        around the base of the hill.

        There are three names for this hill: Phnom Udong, Phnom Preah Reach Troap and Phnom Edthareus. The site includes
        the summits of five hills: Chetdei, Trai Treung, Chetdei Kampul Buon, Preah Ang Chol Nipean, and Ariya Kasaks.
        Chetdy and Trai Treung summits are the same height. The area of Phnom Udong is about 1,500 meters by 700 meters
        from the east to the west.

        Close up, Udong actually appears as two hump-backed hills. The smaller is topped by shrines and the remains of
        Ta San mosque, built by a Cham Muslim on ground given to him for the purpose by one of the ancient kings. The
        main hill is said to be shaped like a naga. The stupas on the main hill house the remains of past monarchs,
        includil'lg King Moniyang and King Ang Duong. A new huge stupa at the end of the mountain ridge was completed in
        2002 and built to hold relics of the Buddha. The relics, once housed in a small stupa near the railroad station
        in Phnom Penh, were .relocated to the new stupa by King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk in
        December 2002.

        This site is of particular interest to visitors seeking to learn about early Cambodian history. Udong was home
        to several kings when it served as the Cambodian capital between AD 1618 and 1866. In addition, it offers more
        than an exhibit of ancient history. At the top of the stairs on the left lies the city's most impressive
        structure, Vihear Preah Edthareus, sanctuary of the 18 cubit Buddha, retains the scars of heavy strafing
        inflicted in face-to-face firefights between Khmer Rouge, Lon Nol and American troops in the 1970s. The eight
        huge columns of the shrine rise into the sky, the roof they once supported was destroyed when Khmer Rouge forces
        blew up the temple in 1977. The arm and part of one side of a huge Buddha remains, and his face has placed at
        the foot of the pedestal and a modern shrine built around it.

        However, the severity of the fighting and the extent of the damage to this once magnificent building do not take
        away from its haunting beauty. The views of the surrounding countryside from entire ridge are breathtaking, and
        the silence casts an air of serenity over the battleground of a war long past.</p>

    <h2>3. Phnom Edtharoes</h2>
    <p> Phnom Edtharoes located at the Communes of Psardek and Phnom Bat in Ponhea Leu District. The
        mountain of Edtharoes has three nemes called Phnom Udong or Phnom Preah Reachtrop or Phnom Edtharoes, which can
        be accessed by National Road No 5 "Phnom Penh-Battambang " ie from Phnom Penh to the turning road at Kilomet 37
        and turn left about 3.50 Kilometers by red soil Road. The total distance from Phnom Penh to the mountain is
        40.50 Kilometers. If we go from Ta Khmao to the mountain, the distance is 51.50 Kilometers. The mountain of
        Edtharoes lasts from the North to the South in a length of 1,500 Meters and its width of 700 Meters.

        The mountain surrounded by roads including the eastern and western roads. At the North of the mountain, there is
        Phnom village and at the South, there is Porane village. The mountain has five peaks: The one-stupa peak has
        equal height to the Tri Treng peak, the mountain peak, the four-stupas peak, The peak of Preah Ang Chol Nipean
        and the peak of Ariya Kasbak. In addition, this site has natural beauty with the beautiful scenery and fresh
        air, which can attracts visitors especially by the history concerning the building of the Royal Palace from
        17th-19th century (1620-1866) during the reign of King Chey Chetha II. This region has 18 ancient stupas.</p>
