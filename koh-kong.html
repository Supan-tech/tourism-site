    <h1>Place to visit in Koh Kong</h1>
    <h2>1.Kbal Chhay waterfall</h2>
    <p>Kbal Chhay waterfall is located in Mondul Seima district, about 16 kilometers north of Koh Kong provincial town.
        Kbal Chhay or Koh Por is a natural site along a high mountain range and forest. To reach Koh Por, visitors
        travel along a stream amid beautiful scenery.Kbal Chhay gets its water from the Pursat stream. The waterfall is
        10 meters high and 8 meters wide during the rainy season. In dry season there is less water, so locals and
        tourists visit the site and relax under the big rocks that resemble a cave.

        Kbal Chhay or Koh Por? Both? Apparently it is still not clear what name to give this waterfall located in Koh
        Kong province, Cambodia. Possibly Kbal Chhay is not used as often, now that Koh Kong is asserting itself on the
        tourist map. Kbal Chhay is also the name of neighboring Kampong Som province's only waterfall and as such a
        major tourist destination there. Operators naming this Koh Por makes sense as it distinguishes it from the other
        Kbal Chhay.Accomadation is to be had in Koh Kong town as well as food. Nothing exists near the falls, so
        bringing something with you is advisable. It's a great place to while away.

        The waterfall of Kbal Chhay has many sources from the mountain rank at the seaside. The history of Kbal Chhay
        waterfall was found in 1960. Until 1963 Kbal Chhay arranged as the clean-water sources for providing to Sihanouk
        Ville, but the arrangement was failed became a hidden place for Khmer Rouge.In 1997, Kbal Chhay was changed to
        the developing zone. In 1998 Kbal Chhay was for bid by Kok An Company on constructing road and changing this
        site as tourist resort for local and international tourists. Nowadays, the Royal Government of Cambodia has
        changed his site as the clean-water sources for providing clean water to Sihanouk Ville.</p>
    <h2>2.Ta Tai</h2>
    <p>Ta Tai waterfall is a semi-natural site located in Ta Tai village, Ta Tai commune, Smach Meanchey district, about
        20 kilometers east of Koh Kong provincial town along National Road 48. There are 84 families living in this
        area. They earn their living by fishing and hunting.

        The waterfall has two stages. The first stage is 5 to 6 meters high; the second stage is 12 to 15 meters high.
        Ta Tai waterfall was developed as a model site in Koh Kong to attract local and foreign tourists.Ta Tai
        waterfall is also known as Ta Eysei waterfall. According to legend, a man named Ta Tai and his son went to the
        waterfall to fish because the waterfall was the joining point between fresh water and salt water. There was a
        storm and the resulting floods carried away Ta Tai's son.

        Four or five days later, however, the boy was found at the same spot from where he disappeared. When Ta Tai
        questioned his son, the boy said: "There is someone who took me to a secret place, where he turned into a
        vampire and wanted to kill me. But suddenly Ta Eysei (a hermit) appeared to save me and took me back." After
        hearing the story, Ta Tai and his wife believed that their son was saved by Ta Eysei or Neak Sachang (another
        mane of hermit). Ever since then, the Waterfall has been called Ta Eysei Waterfall or Ta Tai Waterfall.</p>
    <h2>3.Koh Sdech</h2>
    <p>Koh Sdech is located in Kirisakor district, about 81 kilometers south of Koh Kong provincial town. It attracts
        visitors from Sihanoukville and Sre Ambil district.Koh Sdech features a long beach, and the sea is filled with a
        variety of fish. The site is excellent for snorkeling or scuba diving, as the water is clear, and an array of
        coral can be seen growing at the bottom of the sea. According to legend, there once was a king who commanded an
        army on the island. Because there was no fresh water, the king searched everywhere to find some. At last he
        found a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might contain water, the king drew his sword and split open the
        rock, releasing an endless flow of water that local people still use today.</p>
