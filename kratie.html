    <h2>2.Irrawaddy Dolphins</h2>
    <p>Irrawaddy Dolphins about fifteen to twenty of these rare freshwater dolphins make their home on a beautiful
        stretch of the Mekong River near a small set of rapids. They make upward arches, breaking the surface of the
        water as they swim about the area. They are not jumpers like their sea-faring relatives and are quite a bit
        shyer as well. They have good reason to be shy towards humans as they have been hunted and killed by fishermen
        in the past. The hope is that their numbers will slowly increase, as more fishermen in the area are educated
        about them. They are most active in the early morning hours (around 6 am) and the late afternoon and early
        evening hours.
