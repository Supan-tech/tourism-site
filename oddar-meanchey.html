    <h1>Place to visit in Oddar Meanchey</h1>
    <h2>1.Champei waterfall</h2>
    <p>Champei waterfall or Laang Ta Thong waterfall is 35 kilometers northeast of Odda Meanchey provincial town. A
        natural site, is includes a huge boulder that measures 500 meters squar. There is also a mountain valley on both
        sides of the waterfall and the surrounding area is full of flowers, particulary orchids.

        About 500 meters from the waterfall, there is a natural and cultural site organized by the monks who meditate at
        the site. Known as Ruot Champei, it has a number of statues that describe the life process from birth until
        death, as well as other religious and wildlife statues.

        The provincial tourism office is organizing and developing other attractions in Oddar Meanchey province,
        including: Tonle Sar site, O'Angkrong site, Sneung temple, Tropiang Baray, Por Temple, Kuy Plantation, Beung
        Snor, Tumnub Thmei and Toul Kruoy, a killing field during the Khmer Rouge regime and the site of a Khmer Rouge
        prison.</p>
    <h2>2. O'Smach</h2>
    <p>O'Smach is on the Cambodian-Thai border, about 41 kilometers north of Oddar Meanchey provincial town. The town
        features a resort which includes a number of casinos, good restaurants and luxury hotels. The resort has been
        organized by the Royal Group and VIP Shop Group companies.The O Smach Resort has an impressive entry complete
        with a giant glowing green lotus set in a fountain. The resort has beautifully maintained grounds which feature,
        for some unknown reason, two military armoured vehicles decorated with Christmas lights.

        The O Smach resort has a casino and 198 hotel rooms and suites. Room facilities include satellite tv, aircon, en
        suite, mini bar etc.The resort facilities include a restaurant, 24 hour coffee shop, swimming pool, gym, sauna
        and massage parlour. Across the road is the Royal Hill Resort, offering yet another casino and hotel complex.
        Prices and facilities are similar to those at the O Smach Resort.The gaming rooms and interior of the Royal Hill
        Resort are rather utilitarian, in stark contrast with the impressive entry arch way and shrine in the grounds.O
        Smach in Cambodia is located 100 metres over the border checkpoint at Kap Choeng, Thailand. It is 68 Km south of
        Surin and 440 Km from Bangkok. From O Smach it is 150 Km to the world famous Angkor Wat ruins near the town of
        Siem Reap.

        As at 2006 the road to Siem Reap was poor and the journey can take all day by truck. A road is being constructed
        to Siem Reap which will improve this journey markedly.If you are entering Thailand from Cambodia at this border
        crossing most nationalities will be granted a visa on arrival at no cost. Entering Cambodia from Thailand you
        are required to pay 1000 baht for a 30 day visa. The border point re opened in 2002 after being closed for a
        number of years to due fighting on the Cambodian side. O Smach was the scene of heavy fighting in 1997 as the
        remnants of Sihanouk?s forces battled opposing forces. Peace came in 1998 and the military evicted local
        residents and sold off the land to the casino developers.

        The border at O'smach is definetly open for foreigners. Exited Cambodia there with one Thai registered bike and
        one Cambodian registration. Thai 30 day visas on entry and normal customs , but quick as no one goes thru with
        vehicles as they park on the Thai side a walk/songtow to the casinos just across the border.On the Thai side it
        is called Chong Chom The border post can be found by following Higway 214 south from Surin. From the Cambodian
        side the road from Anlong Veng to O'smach is very good, 100-120 kmh easy, demining going on along the road.The
        road up the escarpment is also good.Also a good road north from the Sisophon-Siem Riep road.An alternate border
        post for those sick of Aranyapratet.

        Also noticed new tempory export procedures at Aran, now need to stamp passport out first, then back to customs,
        then to immigaration again for an airline crew(yes!) list , 2 copies of everything (B50 for copies-no receipt),
        then exit at immigration. Takes a lot longer than the previous 5 minutes. Cambodian side, if you stop at the
        customs they want to see a Carnet, which of course you can't get for a Thai rego bike.After a while they just
        stamp the back of the Thai export paper if you agree to come back thru there on the way back, I never have
        because you normally can't find anyone or I'm in a hurry. Interesting to note that there was no Cambodian
        customs at O'smach.</p>
    <h2>3. The Cultural Site Of Khmer Rouge (Tamok House)</h2>
    <p>In Anlong Veng district, along Road 68, about 100 kilometers east of Oddar Meanchey provincial town, is a house
        once owned by former Khmer Rouge Commander Ta Mok. From 1979 until late 1997, this area was organized and
        controlled by the Khmer Rouge armies. Some remaining statues describe the way the rebels lived and how they
        arranged their troops during their bloody struggle against the government.

        In additional, in the forest is a pile of tires which is believed to be the funeral pyre and burial site of Pol
        Pot, the leader of Khmer Rouge. Many tourists go to Anlong Veng to see and photograph the sites and activitues
        associated with the former regime, and the government has discussed turning this area into a historical site to
        attract even more tourists.</p>
