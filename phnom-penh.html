    <h1>Place to visit in Phnom Penh</h1>
    <h2>1.The Royal Palace</h2>
    <p>The Royal Palace of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះបរមរាជវាំង) is a complex of buildings which serves as the royal
        residence of the King of Cambodia. Its full name in Khmer is the Preah Barom Reacheaveang Chaktomuk Serey
        Mongkol (Khmer: ព្រះបរមរាជវាំងចតុមុខសិរីមង្គល). The Cambodian monarchs have occupied it since it was built in
        the 1866s, with a period of absence when the country came into turmoil during and after the reign of the Khmer
        Rouge.

        The palace was constructed between 1866 and 1870, after King Norodom relocated the royal capital from Oudong to
        Phnom Penh. It was built atop an old citadel called Banteay Keo. It faces approximately East and is situated at
        the Western bank of the cross division of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong River called Chaktomuk (an allusion
        to Brahma).</p>
    <h2>2.Toul Sleng</h2>
    <p>The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (Khmer: សារមន្ទីរឧក្រិដ្ឋកម្មប្រល័យពូជសាសន៍ទួលស្លែង, romanized: Saromontir Ukredth
        Kamm Braly Pouchsasa Tuol Sleng) or simply Tuol Sleng (Khmer: ទួលស្លែង, Tuŏl Slêng [tuəl slaeŋ]; lit. "Hill of
        the Poisonous Trees" or "Strychnine Hill") is a museum chronicling the Cambodian genocide. Located in Phnom
        Penh, the site is a former secondary school which was used as Security Prison 21 (S-21; Khmer: មន្ទីរស-២១) by
        the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 until its fall in 1979. From 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were
        imprisoned at Tuol Sleng and it was one of between 150 and 196 torture and execution centers established by the
        Khmer Rouge and the secret police known as the Santebal (literally "keeper of peace").[2] On 26 July 2010, the
        Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia convicted the prison's chief, Kang Kek Iew, for crimes against
        humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.[3] He died on 2 September 2020 while serving a life
        sentence.[4]</p>
    <h2>3.Wat Phnom</h2>
    <p>Wat Phnom (Khmer: វត្តភ្នំ, UNGEGN: Vôtt Phnum, ALA-LC: Vatt Bhnaṃ [ʋɔət pʰnom]; "Mountain Pagoda") is a Buddhist
        temple (wat) in Doun Penh, Phnom Penh. It is a pagoda, that symbolizes the name of Phnom Penh, and a historical
        site that is part of the Khmer national identity. Wat Phnom has a total height of 46 meters (150 ft).[1] The
        pagoda is named after Lady Penh from the story of the discovery of the five statues: four Buddha statues and one
        Vishnu statue.</p>
