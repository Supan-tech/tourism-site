    <h1>Place to visit in Siem Reap</h1>
    <h2>1. Angkor Handicraft 1 </h2>
    <p> How to go: 1.5 km (5mn) From Provincial Town. Location: Description: Location : Stoeng Thmey
        Village,Sway Dongkom Commune, SR District.</p>
    <h2>2. River & Park Area</h2>
    <p>The Siem Reap River parkways and the big park in front of the Hotel Grand d'Angkor are nice for a jog, stroll and
        people watching, especially in the early evening hours when the locals are out in numbers. The river area is
        pleasant and the park is nicely landscaped. There are plenty of drink and snack vendors around. The king's Siem
        Reap residence is just across from the park.</p>
    <h2>3. Kampong Pluk</h2>
    <p>Kampong Pluk is about 20 Km locates on the Southeast of Siem Reap Town. Two ways are accessible to Kompong Pluk,
        a charter boat ride from Chong Kneas takes one and a half hour and the other by overland just one hour by car,
        upon arrival at dock meet a boatman drives a long a small stream to the village. In dry period we can drive
        motorbike or car all the way to the village because the road is clear.

        Over 3000 inhabitants are real Khmers, their households made of wood and bamboo built on stilts of about 6m to
        7m high. During dry season when the lake is low and lack of water those buildings look like the skyscrapers. At
        this time of the year many of villagers move out onto the lake and build a provisional stilted houses. In wet
        season while the water level rises up again, the dwellers move back to their permanent houses on the flood
        plain, the stilts now hidden under the water. People made a living by catching fishes produce as well as smelly
        fish paste, fermented fish, smoked fish, dried fish, dried prawn etc.

        Upon arrival this village we will explore the above activities and we can have a chat with children at private
        English class, then stop at Buddhist Island to see Buddha paintings. The last fascinating spot, we take a mini
        boat row to see flooded mangrove forest surrounds the area and it is home to a variety of wildlife including
        crabs, snakes, rats etc.</p>
    <h2>4. East Mebon</h2>
    <p>East Mebon How to go: Location: Description: Also built in the 10th Century by Rajendravarman, this temple was
        situated on a small island in the middle of the Oriental, or Eastern, Baray. It has all the characteristics of
        the mountain temple but was accessible by boat only. From the inscriptions found close to it, we know that
        Rajendravarman dedicated it to his parents.

        East Mebon is a large temple-mountain-like ruin, rising three levels and crowned by five towers. Jayavarman IV,
        a usurper to the throne, moved the capital from Angkor to Koh Ker in 928AD. Sixteen years later Rajendravarman
        II returned the capital to Angkor and shortly thereafter constructed East Mebon on an island in the middle of
        the now dry Eastern Baray. The temple is dedicated to Shiva in honor of the king?s parents. Inscriptions
        indicate that it was also built to help reestablish the continuity of kingship at Angkor in light of the
        interruption that occurred when the seat of power had been moved to Koh Ker. There seems to be some scholarly
        debate as to whether East Mebon should be categorized as a temple-mountain. Inscriptions record activity at the
        temple as early as 947AD, but East Mebon was not consecrated until 952AD.

        You need to use quite a bit of imagination when visiting the East Mebon temple. It's not that the temple is
        badly ruined. The imagination is needed to think of the temple as it originally existed, as an island in the
        middle of a large artificial lake, the Eastern Baray.

        When it was built, around 952, the East Mebon must have been quite impressive. The pyramidal structure consists
        of three concentric tiers crowned by five towers. It is a typical motif of many Angkor temples, which seek to
        represent Mount Meru, the location of the Hindu "heaven". It must have been highly symbolic, rowing a boat
        across the lake to one of the temple's four landings, then climbing up the tiers to pray at the shrines.

        On arriving at the temple, one of the first things you'll notice is are the large elephants standing at each
        corner of the lowest tier. The elephants are carved from a single block of stone. Gateways in the center of each
        side lead up to the second and third platforms.

        It was realised during the reign of Yasovarman towards the end of the 9th century and supplied by waters from
        the Siem Reap river. This vast reservoir served to regulate the flow of the river and to irrigate the
        surrounding plain, is today given over to rice fields. To judge by the laterite steps that surround the small
        island of the Mebon, the original depth of water contained was approximately three metres and its volume must
        have been some 40 million cubic metres.

        The Mebon has all the characteristics of a 'temple-mountain' symbolising Mount Meru - here there is a
        three-metre high central platform carrying the quincunx of towers. Originally the Mebon temple stood on an
        island surrounded entirely by the waters of the Eastern Baray - accessible only by boat. The centre of the baray
        was marked by this small island of 120 metres across on which the temple stands. The main entry pavilion of the
        Royal Palace and the Victory Gate of Angkor Thom were subsequently aligned along this axis.

        Several inscriptions found in the vicinity as well as the foundation stele - dated 952 (only nine years prior to
        Pre- Rup) describe the placing in the various sanctuaries of the linga Sri Rajendresvara, of several gods -
        notably Shiva and Parvati "in the likeness of the mother and the father" of King Rajendravarman in addition to
        Vishnu with Brahma. Eight linga of the god in eight forms were also placed in the eight small towers of the
        surrounding court. The Mebon belongs to a group of temples consecrated to the memory of deified parents.

        According to an inscription, the walls were originally covered externally with a lime-based plaster coating (as
        evident at Pre Rup temple) with the pitted hammer marks in the brickwork to adhere the stucco onto the towers,
        the only remaining evidence. Most lintels remain in place on this monument and are of excellent craftsmanship.
        On the central tower to the east, Indra on a three-headed elephant with flights of figures disgorged by makara,
        under a small frieze of figures in meditation; to the west, Skanda the god of war on his peacock with a line of
        figures holding lotus flowers; and to the south, Shiva on the sacred bull Nandin.
        East Mebon, a 10th century Hindu temple, erected by Rajendravarman II, would have been on an islet in the centre
        of the Eastern Baray, but is now very much on dry land. This temple is like a smaller version of Pre Rup, which
        was built 15 to 20 years later and lies to the south. The temple-mountain form is topped off by the now familiar
        quincuncial arrangement of towers. The elaborate brick shrines are dotted with neatly arranged holes, which
        attached the original plasterwork. The base of the temple is guarded at its corners by perfectly carved stone
        figures of harnessed elephants, many of which are still in a very good state of preservation.

        The East Mebon was built dedicated to the Hindu god of Shiva and honours the parents of the king. Its location
        reflects Khmer architects? concern with orientation and cardinal directions. It was built on a north-south axis
        with Rajendravarman?s state temple, Pre Rup, located about 1,200 meters to the south just outside the baray. The
        East Mebon also lies on an east-west axis with the palace temple Phimeanakas, another creation of
        Rajendravarman?s reign, located about 6,800 meters due west.

        It has two enclosing walls and three tiers. It includes the full array of durable Khmer construction materials:
        sandstone, brick, laterite and stucco. At the top is a central tower on a square platform, surrounded by four
        smaller towers at the platform?s corners. The towers are of brick; holes that formerly anchored stucco are
        visible.

        The sculpture at the East Mebon is varied and exceptional, including two-meter-high free-standing stone
        elephants at corners of the first and second tiers. Religious scenes include the god Indra atop his three-headed
        elephant Airavata, and Shiva on his mount, the sacred bull Nandi. Carving on lintels is particularly elegant.

        East Mebon is a small temple built in the reign of king Rajendravarman, who named the temple 'Yashodharatataka'
        (the reservoir of Yashodhara). King Rajendravarman greatly admired King Yashovarman I, who ruled from 889-900 AD
        and built the East Baray (reservoir). Out of respect, King Rajendravarman built East Mebon at the center of the
        baray. Its main god was Rajendreshvara, a linga of the present king.

        The lovely temple of Mebon, a pyramid of receding terraces on which are placed many detached edifices, the most
        effective being the five towers which crown the top Could any conception be lovelier, a vast expanse of
        sky-tinted water as wetting for a perfectly ordered temple. The East Mebon is 500metre (1,640feet) north of Pre
        Rup. A enter and leave the temple from the east entrance. It was built in the second half of the tenth century
        (952) by king Rajendravarman II, dedicated to Siva (Hindu), an ancestor temple in memory of the parents of the
        king with following the Pre Rup style art.

        The Mebon stands on a small island in the middle of the Eastern Baray, which was a large body of water (2 by 7
        kilometres, 1.2by4.3miles) fed by the Siem Reap River. The temple was accessible only by boat. Today the baray,
        once a source of water for irrigation, is a plain of rice fields and the visitor is left to imagine the original
        majesty of this temple in the middle of a large lake.

        The East Mebon is a temple with five towers arranged like the numbers on a die atop a base with three tiers. The
        whole is surrounded by three enclosures. The towers represent the five peaks of the mythical Mount Meru.

        The stairways of the tiered base are flanked by lions (6). Beautiful monolithic elephants stand majestically at
        the corners of the first and second tiers (7). They are depicted naturalistically with fine detail such as
        harnessing. Tip: The elephant in the best condition, and the most complete, is in the southwest corner.

        The large inner courtyard contains eight small brick towers (8)-two on each side opening to the East. Each one
        has octagonal columns and finely worked lintels with figures amongst leaf decorations. On the East Side of the
        courtyard there are three rectangular laterite buildings (9) without windows opening to the west. The two on the
        left of the entrance are decorated with either scenes of the stories of the nine planets or the seven ascetics.
        Vestiges of bricks above the cornices suggest they were vaulted. There are two more buildings (without windows)
        of similar form at the northwest and southwest (9) comers of the courtyard.</p>
    <h2>5. Baphuon</h2>
    <p>This temple built by Udayadityarvarman II was the most poorly constructed of all the temples in Angkor. From the
        remaining ruins, it is possible to see how imposing it was. This temple hill was dedicated to Shiva, but in its
        reliefs many motives from the Vishnu epic can be seen. Restoration work continues to be carried out on the
        Baphuon.

        North o f the Golden Tower [Bayon]. rises the Tower of Branze [Baphuon] higher even than the Golden Tower : a
        truly astonishing spectacle , with more than ten chambers at its base. Prasat Baphuon is located 200 metres (656
        feet) northwest of the Bayon and south of Phimeanakas.
        A enter and leave at the east.

        Tip:
        Access to the summit is difficult as much of the temple has collapsed and it is overgrown but for those
        stalwarts who want to go to the top, use the way with columns at the east and the temple of Phimeanakas on the
        left. Visitors should walk down the causeway, climb the steps to the first tier, turn left and walk around the
        temple, always keeping it on their right. It was built in middle of the 11th century (1060) by king
        Udayadityavarman II, dedicated to Siva (Hindu) with following Prasat Baphuon.

        BACKGROUND
        The grandeur of Baphuon as described above by Zhou Daguan is unrecognizable today because of the poor condition
        of the temple. The French were in the process of restoring this temple when they were forced leave Angkor in
        1972 because of war. Baphuon is situated inside the royal city of Angkor Thom but dates from the eleventh
        century and was built before the city was established. An interesting feature of Baphuon are the bas-reliefs
        which are scenes carved in small squares.Unfortunately few of these are visible because of the poor state of the
        temple. The narrative themes are realistic depictions of daily life and forest scenes.

        LAYOUT
        Baphuon is a single sanctuary temple-mountain situated on a high base. It is a symbolical representation of
        Mount Meru. A rectangular sandstone wall measuring 425 by 125 metres (1394 by 410 feet) encloses the temple (1).
        A long sandstone elevated approach (200 metres, 656 feet) at the east entrance (3) forms a bridge to the main
        temple. It is supported by three rows of short columns.

        Tip:
        Before walking down the approach turn left at the east entry tower (2) and walk to the end of the gallery for a
        superb view of a four-faced tower of the Bayuon framed by a doorway of Baphuon. The approach is intercepted by a
        pavilion in the shape of a cross (4) with terraces on the left and right sides. Turn left and walk to the
        opening the approach. Continue to the view of the arrangement of the imposing pillars under the approach.
        Continue to the end of the gallery to see a rectangular paved pool (5).

        The temple stands on a rectangular sandstone base with five levels that are approximately the same size, rather
        than the more common form of successively smaller levels. The first, second and third levels are surrounded by
        sandstone galleries. Baphuon is the first structure in which stone galleries with a central tower appear. Two
        libraries (6) in the shape of a cross with four porches stand in the courtyard. They were originally connected
        by an elevated walkway supported by columns.

        The gallery of the enclosure collapsed and, at a later date , the stones from it were modeled into the shape of
        a reclining Buddha (7) that spans the length of the west wall ( the head is on the left, facing the temple) . It
        is an abstract form and the outline of this Buddha is difficult to distinguish. A stairway (8) leading to the
        summit begins in the middle of the Buddha. The top level is in poor condition due to several collapses.
        Originally there was a Central Sanctuary with two wings. Each side of the entrance to the Central Sanctuary is
        carved with fine animated figures. If you look carefully you can see these from the ground on the west side.

        Tip:
        The view from the top with Phnom Bakheng in the south and Phimeanakas in the north is magnificent.</p>
