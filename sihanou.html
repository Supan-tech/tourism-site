    <h1>Place to visit in Sihanouk Ville</h1>
    <h2>1.Phnom Leu</h2>
    <p>Phnom Leu is a nature and cultural site. There is a pagoda on the mountaintop, which offer visitors a panoramic
        view of the beaches and Sihanoukville international port. Most visitors are local people who visit the site
        during national festivals.</p>
    <h2>2.Prek Treng beach</h2>
    <p>Also known as the â€˜Hun Sen Beach,â€™ the Prek Treng Beach a few kilometers north of town is a long, narrow
        crescent of sand, a bit rocky in parts, offering comparatively warm shallow waters. Due to Prek Trengâ€™s
        distance from town and complete lack of services (no guesthouses, restaurants, beach chairs, etc.,) the beach is
        usually deserted. There is a nearby development project promising a busy future for Prek Treng, but at the
        moment you can have the beach pretty much to yourself. Just remember to bring drinks and snacks as there are
        very rarely beach vendors available. To get there follow Hun Sen Beach Drive north a few kilometers past the
        port area. The beach is on the left just past the first bridge and before you reach the oil port.</p>
