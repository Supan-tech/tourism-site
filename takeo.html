    <h1>Place to visit in Takeo</h1>
    <h2>1. Phnom Ta Mao (Zoo)</h2>
    <p>Phnom Ta Mao (Zoo) is located in Tro Pang Sap village, Tro Pang Sap commune, Ba Ti District, Takeo province.
        Phnom Tamao can be accessible by the National Road No 2 in 40-kilometre distance from Phnom Penh. Then turning
        right more five kilometers by a trail, it takes 45-minute drive from Phnom Penh. Phnom Ta Mao is a varied site
        consisting of temples, mountain, nature and a big zoo in Cambodia. Phnom Ta Mao has 2,500-hectar land area
        called forest-protected area; in this area, the Department of Forestry has taken 1,200-hectar land area for
        planning trees and 70-hectar land area for organizing zoo.

        The 70-hectar landarea consisting of five mountains namely: Phnom Ta Mao, Phnom Thmor Dos, Phnom Phdan Poan,
        Phnom Chhoy and Phnom Bang. Among the five mountains, two mountains have ancient temples are: - Ta Mao Temple
        (is located at Phnom Ta Mao): was built in 11th century during the reign of the king, Soryak Varman I dedicated
        to Brahmanism, the temple made of Thmor silt and red-solid brick, located on the peak of 30-meter mountain of Ta
        Mao, near Ta Mao pagoda. Now, the temple is damaged and is almost unrecognizable. - Thmor Dos Temple (is located
        at Phnom Thmor Dos): The temple is located on a 35-meter mountain of Thmor Dos, Northwest of Ta Mao temple and
        was built in 11th century.

        The temple made of Thmor silt mad red-solid brick. Now, most of the temples are damaged. The people want to go
        to this temple to worship than Ta Mao temple. In addition, Phnom Ta Mao has a big zoo in Cambodia; the zoo is
        under the supervision of the Department of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture and has 84 varieties of animals and
        birds; two kinds of them are brought from abroad. - There are 150-fourfooted animals consisting of 38 kinds. -
        There are 300 birds consisting of 38 kinds. - There are 30 reptiles consisting of eight kinds. All these animals
        are brought here by the Ministry of Agriculture and by seizing from offenders who illegally traffic in wild
        animals through out Cambodia. To take care these animals, we need to expend US$ 120 per day for food, and 22
        staff and workers are working there.

        The average number of tourists visiting Phnom Ta Mao is 500-600 visitors per week; but during the festivals,
        there are 7,000-8,000 visitors per week. The local people of four communes around the Phnom Ta Mao are earning
        money from selling food to tourists. We can extend package-tour program to the above two resorts because these
        resorts are the popular sites for local and international tourists, and their location is near Phnom Penh. As
        the sites can attract many tourists, we expect to lure investors to invest in tourist facilitation and
        constructing the trail from the national Road No 2 to the resorts. The Department of Forestry has a project on
        constructing an inside trail linking from Tonle Ba Ti to Phnom Ta Mao in Six-Kilometre distance.</p>
    <h2>2. Phnom Chiso</h2>
    <p>Phnom Chiso is a historical site located in Sia village, Rovieng commune, Samrong district, about 62 kilometers
        south of Phnom Penh or 27 kilometers north of Takeo provincial town. To reach the site, take National Road 2 to
        Bati district and Neang Khmao temple. Turn right at the sign for the site and head down the dirt trial for 5
        more kilometers. Phnom Chiso is 13O-meter-high mountain.

        Phnom Chiso temple was built in the early 11th century by King Suryavarman I (AD 1002-1050), who practiced
        Brahmanism. Constructed of sandstone and other stones, it is 60 meters long and 50 meters wide and sits atop a
        mountain. The temple is surrounded by two galleries. The first gallery is 60 meters long on each side. The
        second, smaller gallery, is in the middle, where there is the main worship place with two doors and a wooden
        statue. There are beautiful sculptures on the lintel and the pillars.

        Phnom Chiso Pagoda was built in 1917, destroyed by war during the 1970s and rebuilt in 1979. Behind it is a hall
        called Thammasaphea, kof and a worship place. There is an ancient water tank made of concrete. People usually
        climb the staircase on the west side of the mountain, which has 390 steps and descend by the south side
        staircase, which has 408 steps. Another set of stairs in front of the temple links the temple to Sen Chhmos
        temple, Sen Phouvang temple and Tonie Om, a lake considered sacred by Brahmans and used for washing away sins. A
        large rock yard nearby about 100 meters long and 80 meters was once the site of several other temples, but only
        parts of these temples remain standing.

        In addition, there is a mountain cave, Vimean Chan, located about 150 meters south of the temple. It is a quiet
        place for Brahmans or ascetics to meditate. During the Americans' war with Vietnam, the site was bombed,
        dislodging several large rocks that block the entrance to the cave today.

        Hun Sen Phnom Chiso Agricultural and Tourist site is located in Samrong, Bati and Prey Kabas districts. It
        includes a 513 hectare paddy rice field of dry rice, a 1,386 hectares field of wet rice and three water basins -
        Thnos Ta Kong, Tuol Lork and Sen Pea Ream.

        Phnom Chiso is very popular with visitors, especially during festivals, when it is very crowded. The top of the
        mountain affords visitors a panoramic view of Takeo Province rice paddies stretching for kilometers.</p>
